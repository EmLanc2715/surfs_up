## Overview of Analysis

I am opening a surf and shake shop in Hawaii, with the help of an investor named W. Avy. The purpose of the analysis is to show my investor that the business plan is well thought out. He asked me to analyze weather data on the island of Oahu, the location of the the surf and shake shop. After analyzing the data that W.Avy provided, he wanted more information about temperature trends. Specifically he asked for trends for the months June and December, so he could make sure that the new business would be sustainable year-round.

## Data and Results

### Data for June

### Results 

1. The average temperature observed by the weather stations for the month of June, 2016 in Oahu was 75.9 degrees, with a low temp of 64 and a high temp of 85.
 
2. The average temperature observed by the weather stations for the month of December, 2016 in Oahu was 71 degrees, with a low temp of 56 and a high temp of 83.

3. The data was collected six months apart and shows little variability. The biggest difference is that Decembers lowest temp was recorded at 56 degrees, 8 degrees less than the lowest temp in June. 

## Summary

I believe that W.Avy will be very pleased with the results produced from the weather data I analyzed. Although the biggest difference in temperatures between June and December are the lowest temps, it could be seen as negligible, especially since the highest temps for both months are within 2 degrees of each other. To further investigate key differences between June and December on Oahu in relation to surfing and shake sales, I analyzed the precipiation data for the two months as well. 

The tables below illustarte that the precipitation data for June and December of 2016 were fairly similar. The average amount of rainfall for June was 0.14 inches, compared to 0.22 inches in December. Having this little average precipitation in both months illustartes that Oahu is a great place to open a surf and shake shop. However, the highest amount of precipitaiton for June was 4.43 inches and 6.42 inches for December. This would cause alarm if the averages were not so low for both months. These high maximums of precipitation could be explained by heavy rainfall over the course of one to a few days, which would not interfere with the surf and shake shops revenue.

Overall, Oahu seems to be an ideal location for a surf and shake shop.
